            Dash Core Group is pleased to announce the release of Dash Platform v0.20 on testnet. 
            This significant release brings with it major changes in Platform Consensus. These 
            include but are not limited to Validator Set Rotation, Peer-to-peer Layer Optimization 
            and Threshold Signing which are explained below. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Some of these new improvements provide 
            new cryptographic security to Dash Platform making it one of the first examples of a scalable 
            pBFT-based consensus network. This is a very exciting milestone for us.
            </p>

            </p>
            The new release introduces several breaking changes which make previous existing platform data invalid. Instead of adding a significant amount of extra work to handle these changes we had to wipe Layer 2 platform state data as part of this release. Layer 1 Core chain and payment transactions remain untouched.
            In addition, updates to the DashPay wallets for Android and iOS are being verified on this new version of Dash Platform. Alpha Program users will receive an update after stability of the network has been confirmed.
